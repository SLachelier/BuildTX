# Title
BuildTX

# Description
Webapplication using React.js as well as the TxDOT API database. As a Civil Engineer, one of the more tedious but necessary tasks in transportation design is searching construction projects using the TxDOT website. Currently, there is no filtering system or way of bringing up a PDF by just searching up the project number. BuildTX was created to quickly search and filter construction projects. 

# Additional technologies used
react-modal-image
react-router-dom
react-icons
SASS
